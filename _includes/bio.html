<p style="text-align:justify;">
  I am a tenure-track faculty member at the <a href="https://www.cispa.de" target="_blank">CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security</a>, where my research focuses on privacy-preserving and applied cryptography. My work explores the design and analysis of secure systems and protocols that enable strong privacy guarantees, bridging foundational research and practical applications. Before my current position, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at
  <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford University</a> and a Research Group Leader at CISPA.

  I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="https://ipipan.waw.pl/en/" target="_blank">
    Institute for Computer Science of the Polish Academy of Sciences</a> in Warsaw, which I obtained in January 2016 (with distinction) under the supervision of Prof. Mirosław Kutyłowski. I have had the privilege of publishing my work at premier venues in computer science, including Crypto, Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt, USENIX Security, IEEE S&P, and CCS. My contributions have been recognized through various honors, most notably the IBM Great Minds Award. I am also an active member of the cryptographic community and a regular participant in international conferences and workshops.

  My broader research interests include privacy-enhancing cryptography and the practical deployment of cryptographic schemes in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. At CISPA, I aim to advance both theoretical and applied aspects of cryptography to address the critical challenges posed by modern information security.
